## My name is Jaap-Jan van de Geest. I am a Pipeline TD student at the "Nederlandse Filmacademie".

I love building tools and making improvements to the pipeline at my school. All to make life more easy for my classmates at school. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving Botgrid. This is a tool that will give users slack messages from their updates in ShotGrid. I hope to release this to the public around april.
